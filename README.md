# TuffyCart
CSUF Senior Project
This code is intended to control motors using an Arduino Uno that receives gps signals from an APM 2.6 board.
Contact Chris Painter with questions @ cmspainter3@gmail.com

Notes: Currently using the Gas & Steering 1.0 for our current goals. Anything else at the moment is a slightly tweaked version of these two files.
- Also if order for code to work need to have the Adafruit Motor Library
